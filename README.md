Ohhh so fancy. Super simple cli for writing fancy commit messages

## ðŸš€ Install
```
npm install -g fancy-commit
```

### ðŸ™ˆ Alias
I chose the name `fancy-commit` as it was nice and wouldn't clash with any other cli tool. I recomend aliasing it to something else in your command line. For bash I add the following line to my `.bashrc` file ðŸ˜Š
```
alias gc='fancy-commit'
```
